# BedrockFOVKeybinder - for Windows 10
AutoHotKey script that allows you to remap the Bedrock FOV Changer key to special keys like Left Control. Used in addition with [https://github.com/XroixHD/MCBE-Win10-FOV-Changer](https://github.com/XroixHD/MCBE-Win10-FOV-Changer).

## Installation:
### In the FOV Changer application, set the key to zoom in to "p". The downloadable executable sets the keybind to LeftControl, but you may change it to anything else by editing fov_changer_keybind.ahk. Download the standalone executable from [here](https://github.com/LukasPAH/BedrockFOVKeybinder/releases/latest) and run while playing Minecraft Windows 10 Edition. You may also place the executable in the following folder for it to run automatically:
```
%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup
```
